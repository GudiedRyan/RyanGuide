My name is Ryan Guide. I lived in Pittsburgh until I turned 4, then I moved to State College where I currently live. In 2016 I attended Allegheny College, where I graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 2020. As the pandemic shut down the world, I began looking into new paths to follow. In the summer of 2021, I met with [Dr. Patrick McDaniel](https://patrickmcdaniel.org/), and joined the [SIIS Lab](https://cybersecurity.psu.edu/). Ever since then I have been working on my Master's degree at Penn State University. I am graduating December 2022.
